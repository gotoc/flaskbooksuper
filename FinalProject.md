Final Project
Congratulations on finishing the course! Now it's time for you to use all the skills you have learned throughout these lessons.

Your task is now to build the following new functionalities for the Flaskbook social application:

    Finish the pagination of the feed, so that users are presented with a "Older >>" button at the end of the feed that takes users to the same URL but showing the next oldest set of posts.
    At that page, you will also render a "<< Newer" button and if there are more posts, present another "Older >>" button.

    Allow users to edit their posts by introducing an "Edit" link next to the "Comment" link.

    Build a completely new Blueprint module called "Mail", where users are able to write Private Messages between them, but offer the functionality only if users are friends.
    Create a page where users can enter the message content, notify the user via email that he has a new pending message and allow the receiving user to reply or delete the message.

If you complete this project, please share it with everyone here by adding a comment to this lesson with the URL link to your Github repository.
Students that complete this project will be awarded with special coupons for some the upcoming courses I'm working on.

Looking forward to your contributions!
